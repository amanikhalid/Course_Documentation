Types of Algorithms:
1.     Sequential Algorithm:
-       This Algorithm compares between values (x,y,z,..)
-       Determine which value is the largest.

2.     Iterative Algorithm:
-       It goes through a group of values one by one.
-       Compare the largest value with the others.
-       If it found a largest value it updates the largest.
-       It returns the largest value in the group.

3.     Recursive Algorithm
