Algorithm Programming Components:
Algorithm programming consists of:

Input: Data provided to the algorithm.

Processing: Operations performed on the input data.

Output: Result produced after processing.

Flow control: Loops and conditions to control the flow of execution.



Example: To compute the sum of numbers from 1 to N:

Input: N (user provides a number).

Processing: Add numbers from 1 to N.

Output: The sum.
