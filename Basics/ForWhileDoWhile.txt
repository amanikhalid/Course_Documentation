Looping (for, while, and do-while)
for loop: Used when you know the number of iterations beforehand.

For Example
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);  // Outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}



do-while loop: Similar to a while loop, but guarantees that the block of code will execute at least once.

For Example
int i = 0;
do
{
    Console.WriteLine(i);  // Outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
