B.4. Scrum framework for Agile:
Scrum meetings are an essential part of the Scrum framework.
In fact, according to the Agile Manifesto, development teams need to engage in face-to-face conversations to exchange information and react to changes quickly. And Scrum meetings are the best way to do that with your team members.
Timing:
Daily Scrum (Daily Stand-up) (15 min)
Sprint Review (1-2 hours)
Sprint Retrospective (1-2 hours)
Meetings:
1.     Sprint planning meeting
·       When: Held at the start of each sprint.
·       Attendees: The full Scrum team - product owner, Scrum master, and developers.
·       Duration: They usually last about two hours for every week the sprint lasts. So, a two-week sprint would involve a four-hour planning session before work commences.
·       Purpose: The team reviews the product backlog, sets the sprint goal, and plans the work for the upcoming sprint.
2.     Daily Scrum (Stand-up) meeting
·       When: Daily, typically first thing in the morning.
·       Attendees: All Scrum team members — the product owner, Scrum master, and developers,
·       Duration: No longer than 15 minutes.
·       Purpose: A short daily meeting where team members share progress, identify blockers, and plan their work for the day.
3.     Sprint review meeting
·       When: At the end of a sprint.
·       Attendees: All the Scrum team members, plus key stakeholders invited by the product owner.
·       Duration: About an hour for every week of a sprint. So, a two-week sprint should be followed by a two-hour review session.
·       Purpose: The team demonstrates the work completed and gathers feedback from stakeholders.
4.     Sprint retrospective meeting
·       When: At the end of a sprint.
·       Attendees: The whole Scrum team — product owner, Scrum master, and developers.
·       Duration: Typically, 45 minutes per sprint week. For example, the average length of a Sprint retrospective would be 90 minutes for a two-week sprint.
·       Purpose: The team reflects on what went well, what didn’t, and identifies areas for improvement.
5.      Backlog refinement meeting
·       When: Before the sprint planning meeting.
·       Attendees: The product owner and some or all of the developers and Scrum master.
