Errors in Programming:
Errors in programming refer to mistakes or bugs that prevent a program from working as expected.

There are many types of errors which are:
1. Syntax Errors: These occur when the code does not follow the correct syntax 
e.g., missing semicolons, parentheses).


For Example:


    {
        int number = 5;
        Console.WriteLine("The number is: " number); // Syntax error: Missing + for concatenation
    }




2. Runtime Errors: These occur while the program is running
 (e.g., division by zero, accessing null objects).

For Example:

    {
        int x = 22;
        int y = 0;

        Console.WriteLine(x / y); // Runtime error: Division by zero
    }



Logical Errors: These occur when the program runs without crashing, but the results are incorrect because of a flawed logic or algorithm.

For Example:

    {
        int num1 = 5;
        int num2 = 2;
        
        int result = num1 - num2; // Logical error: should have been num1 + num2
        Console.WriteLine("The result is: " + result); // The result will be incorrect.
    }
