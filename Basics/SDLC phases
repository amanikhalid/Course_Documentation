A-   Software Development Life Cycle:
A.1.
A.1.1. Analysis phase: It’s an essential step because it establishes the project’s direction and ensures that every participant comprehends the project’s purpose. Business Analysts, Project Managers, and Product Owners Also the CTO share responsibility for a well-defined scope. Together, they set SLAs (Service Level Agreements) for gathering, documenting, and validating requirements.
Input:
⦁	Market research
⦁	Business requirements document
⦁	Stakeholder interviews
Output:
⦁	Use case diagrams
⦁	Software Requirement Specification
A.1.2. Design Phase: Here the project’s architectural framework takes shape. this phase involves crafting the technical structure of the software. It’s about defining how all the components fit together, both functionally and financially. In this context, doing the right thing means creating an architecture that aligns with the project’s objectives and scalability requirements. UX/UI designers and System Architects ensure continuous integration and deployment.
Input:
⦁	Business logic and workflow diagrams
⦁	SRS document
Output:
⦁	System architecture design
⦁	UI/UX wireframes
⦁	API designs
A.1.3. Development Phase:
step is the essence of software development, where code is crafted, tested, and refined to bring the project closer to realization.
CTO oversees the development process and ensures alignment with the company’s technology strategy.
The Head of Engineering manages the frontend and backend teams, driving execution excellence.
Frontend, Backend, and Fullstack Engineers write code, conduct code reviews, and ensure code quality.
DevOps Engineers automate deployment processes.
Input:
⦁	Technology stack decisions
⦁	Design documents
Output:
⦁	Source code
⦁	Code documentation
A.1.4. Testing phase: Testing is where potential failures are identified and addressed, preventing issues from reaching end-users. Quality Engineers (QA Engineers), Solutions Architect, Testers, and DevOps are involved in this phase to test scripts and interfaces.
Input:
⦁	Source code
⦁	Test cases
Output:
⦁	Fixed versions of the software
⦁	Test reports
⦁	Bug reports
A.1.5. Deployment Phase: it’s when the product goes live in a real environment. And the beginning of continuous improvement and maintenance. Database Administrators (DBAs) ensure database performance and security.
DevOps Engineers manage continuous integration, delivery, and system updates.
 
Input:
⦁	Tested software build
⦁	Deployment plan
Output:
⦁	Live software system
⦁	Deployment logs
 
A.1.6. Maintenance Phase: For bug fixes and Regular updates to ensure a perfect operation.
Input:
⦁	Bug reports
⦁	User feedback
⦁	Performance logs
Output:
⦁	New feature enhancements
⦁	Updated software versions
⦁	bug fixes
