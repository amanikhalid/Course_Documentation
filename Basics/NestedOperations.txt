Nested Operations:
Nested operations refer to placing one operation (such as a condition or a loop) inside another operation

Nested Conditions:
A nested condition occurs when a condition (if-else, switch, etc.) is placed inside another condition. It allows for more complex decision-making processes

For Example:
using System;

    {
        int age = 20;
        bool hasPermission = true;

        if (age >= 18)
        {
            if (hasPermission)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("You are allowed to enter.");
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("You need permission to enter.");
            }
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("You are not old enough to enter.");
        }
    }

Nested Looping
A nested loop refers to having a loop inside another loop. 

For Example:

    
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
            }
        }
